# ft_traceroute
42 school project, continue the unix network journey by rewriting the network utility traceroute in C (Repost) 

# About the project

re-code the UNIX utility traceroute that tracks the route packets taken from an IP network on their way to a given host. It utilizes the IP protocol's time to live (TTL) field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to the host.
