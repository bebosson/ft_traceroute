# ft_traceroute
42 school project, continue the unix network journey by rewriting the network utility traceroute in C (Repost) 

# About the project

re-code the UNIX utility traceroute that tracks the route packets taken from an IP network on their way to a given host. It utilizes the IP protocol's time to live (TTL) field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to the host.

# To make it work:
Clone the repository and make: it will update the libft's tool, compile the source and create the binary ft_ping.

Then run it with the IP address or the website's name: (don't forget the sudo !)
